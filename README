CODE PRESERVATION

	The modifications made on the generated code can be preserved
	during each generation:
	
	* In the generated pom.xml, protected zones
		are defined by a start and a end marker:
		Start of user code XXX
		End of user code XXX
	 	Code written in these zones are preserved during generation. In order
	 	to ensure that no code will be lost, start and end markers should not 
	 	be removed!
 	* In Java source code, JMerge annotation (@generated) are present on top 
	 	of blocks (Classes, Methods, Attributes). If modifications must be 
	 	preserved, the annotation must be changed to @generated NOT. It will 
	 	avoid the generator to override your modifications by leaving the block.
	 	More information can be found at: 
	 	http://udig.refractions.net/files/docs/latest/1.3.2-SNAPSHOT/developer/guide_to_emf.html
	 	See: "Adding Comments to EMF Generated Methods" and "How to Modify a 
	 	Generated Method".

COMPILATION (using pom.xml, Maven required)

	The generated pom.xml can be used to compile. Just run:
	$ mvn compile
	Files *.classes will be present in 'target/classes'.
