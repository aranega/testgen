The following recommendations are for code preservation
between two generations and default defined Maven command.

CODE PRESERVATION

	The modifications proposed on the generated code can be preserved
	during each generation. In the generated pom.xml, protected zones, 
	defined by a start and a end marker:
	Start of user code XXX
	End of user code XXX
 	Code written in these zones are preserved during generation. In order
 	to ensure that no code will be lost, start and end markers should not 
 	be removed!
 	In Java source code, JMerge annotation (@generated) are present on top 
 	of blocks (Classes, Methods, Attributes). If modifications must be 
 	preserved, the annotation must be changed to @generated NOT. It will 
 	avoid the generator to override your modifications by leaving the bloc.
 	More information can be found here: 
 	http://udig.refractions.net/files/docs/latest/1.3.2-SNAPSHOT/developer/guide_to_emf.html
 	See: "Adding Comments to EMF Generated Methods" and "How to Modify a 
 	Generated Method".

COMPILATION (using pom.xml, Maven required)

	The default generated pom.xml can be used for compilation purposes. Just run:
	$ mvn compile
	Files *.classes will be present in 'target/classes'.
