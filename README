The following recommendations are for code preservation
between two generations and default defined Maven command.

CODE PRESERVATION

	The modifications proposed on the generated code can be preserved
	during each generation. In the generated non java files, protected 
	zones are defined by a start and a end marker:
	Start of user code XXX
	End of user code XXX
 	Code written in these zones are preserved during generation. In order
 	to ensure that no code will be lost, start and end markers should not 
 	be removed!
 	In Java source code, JMerge annotation (@generated) are present on top 
 	of blocks (Classes, Methods, Attributes). If modifications must be 
 	preserved, the annotation must be changed to @generated NOT. It will 
 	avoid the generator to override your modifications by leaving the bloc.
